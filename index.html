                    <a href="https://tealswan.com/completion-process/about-the-process/">Teal Swan's Completion Process</a>.</p>
                <p>It is a powerful process that heals trauma, abuse, unhealthy patterns, PTSD etc. at the root level.</p>

                <p>We will be:

                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Each session will be filled with new insights and knowledge about you.</p>
                <p>We will discover what you went through and what you felt, and perhaps more importantly, what you didn't feel
                    and are yearning to feel.</p>
                <p>I am here to connect with you, hear your stories, share your pain and facilitate your inner healing work.
                </p>
                <p>I invite you to hold my hand as we both dive in and discover the hidden vulnerable parts of you that are
                    begging to be seen, heard and felt.</p>
