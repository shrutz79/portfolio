            <h2 style="margin-top:-6px">Alternative Psychotherapy / Trauma Recovery / Shadow work</h2>

            <p>I am a Certified Practitioner of
                <a href="https://tealswan.com/completion-process/about-the-process/">Teal Swan's Completion Process</a>. It is a powerful process that heals trauma, unhealthy patterns, PTSD
                and more.</p>
            <p class="lessspace">We will be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Working on healing your mental, emotional &amp; spiritual self</li>
                <li>Uncovering the roots of your diseases and ailments</li>
                <li>Discovering and unlocking patterns that are perplexing you</li>
                <li>Gaining new insights and knowledge about who you are</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>The pain you are experiencing today is rooted in your childhood. We will be doing shadow work / inner child work
                to discover what you went through and what you felt, and perhaps more importantly, what you didn't feel,
                and are yearning to feel. I am here to connect with you, hear your stories, share your pain and facilitate
                your inner healing work. I invite you to hold my hand as we both dive in and discover the hidden vulnerable
                parts of you that are begging to be seen, heard and felt.</p>

            <h2>Specialty</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px">Some of the traumas I specialize in are Physical abuse and/or Torture, Emotional abuse and/or <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting">Gaslighting</a>, Domestic
                violence, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_post-traumatic_stress_disorder">Complex PTSD</a>, Surviving Cancer - surgery / chemotherapy / radiation and after effects.</p>
            <p>Feelings of isolation,
                being unwanted and unloved, rage and anger, extreme shame, self hate, powerlessness, hopelessness and being
                suicidal.
            </p>
            <p>We are here to experience the opposite of the pain we went through as children instead of constantly re-living
                it. The Completion Process transforms that pain so that it ceases to reflect in our lives. It enables us
                to experience togetherness instead of isolation, love and safety instead of rejection and abuse, equality
                instead of hierarchy, respectful boundaries instead of violence, etc.
