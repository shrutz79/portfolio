                my heirs, executors, administrators, assigns, or personal representatives, knowingly and voluntarily enter
                into this waiver and release of liability and hereby waive any and all rights, claims or causes of action

                a direct result of my participation in The Completion Process. I AM VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATING IN THE COMPLETION
                PROCESS AND I AM PARTICIPATING IN THE COMPLETION PROCESS ENTIRELY AT MY OWN RISK. I AM AWARE OF THE RISKS
                ASSOCIATED WITH PARTICIPATING IN THE COMPLETION PROCESS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, PHYSICAL
                OR PSYCHOLOGICAL INJURY, PAIN, SUFFERING, ILLNESS, TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT DISABILITY (INCLUDING PARALYSIS),
                ECONOMIC OR EMOTIONAL LOSS, AND DEATH. I UNDERSTAND THAT THESE INJURIES OR OUTCOMES MAY ARISE FROM MY OWN
                OR OTHERS' NEGLIGENCE, CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE COMPLETION PROCESS. NONETHELESS, I ASSUME ALL RELATED RISKS,
                BOTH KNOWN OR UNKNOWN TO ME, OF MY PARTICIPATION IN THE COMPLETION PROCESS, INCLUDING TRAVEL TO, FROM AND

                claims, suits or actions of any kind whatsoever for liability, damages, compensation or otherwise brought
                by me or anyone on my behalf, including attorney's fees and any related costs, if litigation arises pursuant
                to any claims made by me or by anyone else acting on my behalf. If Shruti Mahendra incurs any of these types
                of expenses, I agree to reimburse Shruti Mahendra. I acknowledge that Shruti Mahendra and her directors,
                officers, volunteers, representatives and agents are not responsible for errors, omissions, acts or failures
                to act of any party or entity conducting a specific event or The Completion Process on behalf of Shruti Mahendra.
                I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE COMPLETION PROCESS MAY INVOLVE A TEST OF A PERSON'S MENTAL LIMITS AND MAY CARRY WITH
                IT THE POTENTIAL FOR DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY. The risks may include, but are not limited to, condition of
                participants, including but not limited to, participants, volunteers, event officials and event monitors,
                and/or producers of the event. I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE CAREFULLY READ THIS "WAIVER AND RELEASE" AND FULLY
                UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS A RELEASE OF LIABILITY. I EXPRESSLY AGREE TO RELEASE AND DISCHARGE SHRUTI MAHENDRA
                AND ALL OF HER AFFILIATES, MANAGERS, MEMBERS, AGENTS, ATTORNEYS, STAFF, VOLUNTEERS, HEIRS, REPRESENTATIVES,
                PREDECESSORS, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION AND I AGREE TO VOLUNTARILY
                GIVE UP OR WAIVE ANY RIGHT THAT I OTHERWISE HAVE TO BRING A LEGAL ACTION AGAINST SHRUTI MAHENDRA FOR PERSONAL
                INJURY, EMOTIONAL, MENTAL OR SPIRITUAL INJURY. To the extent that statute or case law does not prohibit releases
                for negligence, this release is also for negligence on the part of Shruti Mahendra, its agents, and employees.
                In the event that I should require medical care or treatment, I agree to be financially responsible for any
                costs incurred as a result of such treatment. I am aware and understand that I should carry my own health
                insurance. I acknowledge and agree to be held liable for any and all costs associated with any actions of
                neglect or recklessness. This Agreement was entered into at arms-length, without duress or coercion, and
                is to be interpreted as an agreement between two parties of equal bargaining strength.</p>

            <p>Both I, the Participant, and Shruti Mahendra agree that this Agreement is clear and unambiguous as to its terms,
                and that no other evidence will be used or admitted to alter or explain the terms of this Agreement, but
                that it will be interpreted based on the language in accordance with the purposes for which it is entered
                into. In the event that any provision contained within this Release of Liability shall be deemed to be severable
                or invalid, or if any term, condition, phrase or portion of this agreement shall be determined to be unlawful
                or otherwise unenforceable, the remainder of this agreement shall remain in full force and effect, so long
                as the clause severed does not affect the intent of the parties. If a court should find that any provision
                of this agreement to be invalid or unenforceable, but that by limiting said provision it would become valid
                and enforceable, then said provision shall be deemed to be written, construed and enforced as so limited.
